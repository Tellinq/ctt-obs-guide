# What is OBS?
Open Broadcaster Software, is a program you can use to record and stream applications. 
These threads will teach you how to configure OBS for all your needs.

### Downloads

Historically, there were a selection of fake advertisements for OBS, containing copies of malicious versions. Regardless if these malicious versions are still available, please know that the **ONLY** domains that OBS will use to advertise the project are https://obsproject.com/ and https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio

You can install OBS using `OBS-Studio-Full-Installer-x64.exe` or get the portable version using `OBS-Studio-Full-x64.zip` located [on the official GitHub releases](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/latest).

<!-- #### Older versions
Years ago, a community had a misconception that newer versions of OBS contained "frame halving" when recording at higher FPS (around 600+), coming to the conclusion that OBS v25.0.8 was the last version that would work properly. This was an entirely separate issue, which does not pertain to OBS.

There is no reason to use older versions of OBS such as `v25.0.8` or `v27`. -->

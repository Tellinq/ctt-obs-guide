# General
## Process Priority
Idle works best for most systems, but try out all of them for yourself.

# Video
## Renderer
Direct3D 11 is the only option.
## Color Format
NV12 (8-bit, 4:2:0, 2 planes) is the best option unless you absolutely need accurate colors or darks, in which case I444 or P010 are the best.
## Color Space
YouTube uses 709, so using this will prevent weird color changes. You can use sRGB if you want higher accuracy, but if you're uploading to YouTube it'll become 709 anyways.
## Color Range
YouTube uses limited, but you can use full if you want.
## SDR White Level / HDR Nominal Peak Level
Leave these at 300 and 1000 respectively.

# No other options in this tab have a significant impact.

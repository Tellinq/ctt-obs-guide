## Base (Canvas) and Output (Scaled) Resolution
**Keep them the same**

If you wish to stretch/scale your video, do it __after recording__ with a nice FFmpeg filter, otherwise you'll be sacrificing performance.

## Downscaling filter
You will be blocked from changing this, ignore.

## Setting up FPS
Using `Fractional` value will let you put any FPS you wish.
